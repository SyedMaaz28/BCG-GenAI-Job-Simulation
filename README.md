# BCG GenAI Job Simulation â€“ Forage (January 2025)

This repository showcases my work completed as part of the **BCG (Boston Consulting Group) Generative AI Job Simulation** on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/). The simulation involved building an **AI-powered financial chatbot** capable of interpreting complex financial data from SEC filings (10-K and 10-Q reports).

## Project Overview

The project demonstrates the potential of **GenAI in consulting** by simulating a client scenario where a chatbot is used to help clients understand financial documents through natural language queries.

## ðŸ’» Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **Rule-Based Logic**
- **Natural Language Processing (basic)**

## ðŸ“Š What I Did

- Extracted and cleaned data from 10-K and 10-Q reports.
- Applied rule-based logic to simulate AI-driven responses.
- Built a prototype chatbot that generates **user-friendly financial insights**.
- Demonstrated how GenAI can enhance financial consulting services.

## ðŸ§  Skills Gained
